# Prototürk Twitter Clone For React 

In this repository, I developed an application using React while simultaneously following the content of Prototürk channel's Twitter clone. This process aimed at acquiring new knowledge in React and gaining hands-on experience. Here are the key technologies I used in this project and the advantages they provided:
## Lessons Learned

React: I opted for React to create a modern and interactive user interface. Its component-based structure allowed me to modularize the application. The advantage of developing each component independently and reusing them made my code more organized and easier to maintain.

Redux: I chose Redux for managing the application state. Redux facilitated centralized state management, regulating data communication between components. It proved particularly advantageous in large and complex applications as a state management tool.

Context API: By utilizing React's Context API, I managed state in smaller and medium-sized applications as an alternative to Redux. It streamlined data sharing between components, enhancing the efficiency of my application.

Headless UI: Headless UI served as a toolkit for creating custom user interfaces. This toolkit enabled me to quickly build and customize the user interface of my application.

Tailwind CSS: I selected Tailwind CSS for styling the application. Its capability to swiftly and flexibly add styles allowed me to easily adapt the design and expedited the project development process.

By employing these technologies, I translated the concepts learned in the video into practical application, resulting in a comprehensive experience of developing a modern React application.
